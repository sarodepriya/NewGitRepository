The Git pull command is used to fetch and merge code changes from the remote 
repository to the local repository. 

Git pull is a combination of two commands, Git fetch followed by Git merge.

In the first stage, 
Git fetch is executed that downloads content from the required remote repository.

Then, the Git merge command combines multiple sequences of commits into a 
single branch.

Git pull *clone or download URL*

All the contents from the repository have been pulled to our local repository.
